# Weather-Project
The Weather Project is a website to display the current weather, weather information and a six day forecast built using Vanilla JavaScript. 

## Roadmap
* Convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* Save user's location or default city.
* Ability to expand today's forecast and see the hourly forcast.

## Project Status
The Weather Project was completed as part of the SheCodesPLus Workshop (May 2021). Any changes from now on are out of the scope of the workhop are being done to learn and showcase my HTML / CSS / JavaScript skills.

## Contributing
Beginners that would like to contrubute to it are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change or add to the project.
